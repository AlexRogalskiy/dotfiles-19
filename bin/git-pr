Basic outline:

1. grab the owner & repo name from the upstream remote
2. grab the branch name and fork user name from the local repo
3. use the pulls api and use the head filter to grab open prs
4. if open, pop open a browser window pointing to open pr
5. if no open prs, pop open a browser window to pr against the base branch
